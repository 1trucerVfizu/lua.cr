Fortunately, there is a simple way to fix this issue and restore the real names in FM 2016 crack version.

Once you have downloaded the file, you need to copy it to the following location: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Football Manager 2016\data\db\1600\lnc\all`. If you have installed the game in a different folder, you need to adjust the path accordingly. You also need to make sure that you overwrite any existing file with the same name.
 
After you have copied the file, you need to restart the game and load your save. You should see that the fake names have been replaced with the real ones. You can now enjoy FM 2016 crack version with authentic names and logos.
 
Note: This method only works for FM 2016 crack version. If you have bought the game legally, you do not need to do this. Also, this method does not affect your save files or achievements. However, it is always advisable to backup your files before making any changes.
  
## Why Do Fake Names Appear in FM 2016 Crack Version?
 
The reason why fake names appear in FM 2016 crack version is because of licensing issues. Some teams, players, and competitions do not have the official permission to be included in the game with their real names and logos. Therefore, the game developers have to use generic or alternative names to avoid legal problems.
 
However, this does not mean that the game is inaccurate or incomplete. The fake names are only cosmetic changes and do not affect the gameplay or the database. The teams and players still have the same attributes, histories, and potentials as their real counterparts. The only difference is how they are displayed on the screen.
 
Some players might not mind playing with fake names, as they can still recognize the teams and players by their colors, kits, and faces. However, some players might prefer to have a more realistic experience and see the real names and logos in the game. This is where the "fake.lnc" file comes in handy.
  
## What Else Can You Do with the "fake.lnc" File?
 
The "fake.lnc" file is not only useful for fixing fake names in FM 2016 crack version. It can also be used to customize other aspects of the game, such as adding new teams, players, competitions, awards, stadiums, cities, and nations. You can also edit existing entries to change their names, colors, logos, or other details.
 
To do this, you need to open the "fake.lnc" file with a text editor such as Notepad or Wordpad. You will see a series of lines that follow a specific format. Each line starts with a command that tells the game what to do, followed by a number that identifies the entry to be modified, followed by a value that specifies the new name or detail.
 
For example, the line `"CLUB_LONG_NAME_CHANGE" 680 "Manchester United"` tells the game to change the long name of the club with ID 680 to "Manchester United". The line `"CLUB_SHORT_NAME_CHANGE" 680 "Man Utd"` tells the game to change the short name of the same club to "Man Utd". The line `"CLUB_KIT_COLOUR_CHANGE" 680 0 0 0 255` tells the game to change the primary kit color of the same club to red (0 0 0 255).
 
You can find the IDs of teams, players, competitions, and other entries by using tools such as [FM Editor Live](https://www.fmscout.com/a-fm-editor-live-2016.html) or [Sortitoutsi Data Update](https://sortitoutsi.net/football-manager-data-update). You can also use online resources such as [Color Hex](https://www.color-hex.com/) or [Brands of the World](https://www.brandsoftheworld.com/) to find color codes and logos for your custom entries.
 
Once you have edited the "fake.lnc" file to your liking, you need to save it and copy it to the same location as before: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Football Manager 2016\data\db\1600\lnc\all`. Then you need to restart the game and load your save. You should see that your changes have taken effect in the game.
